# AUG

**Aug** is a self-hosted personal AI assistant that talks to you via Telegram or REST, ships with powerful tools, doesn't reveal your secrets to the LLM ([hushed](https://github.com/vadimtitov/hushed)), and has a persistent memory system that builds a real picture of you and self across time. Works with any OpenAI-compatible API.

Work in progress.

## Memory

Three plain-text files on disk, injected into the system prompt at runtime, updated by background jobs. No embeddings, no retrieval — everything fits in context.

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `self.md` | The agent's identity: character, values, how it relates to you. Changes rarely — only through weekly reflection, never mid-conversation. |
| `user.md` | Who you are. Biographical facts, core traits. Slow-moving by design. |
| `memory.md` | Everything else: *Present*, *Recent*, *Patterns*, *Significant moments*, *Reflections*, *Longer arc*. |

Mid-conversation, the agent uses the `note` tool to capture things worth remembering. A nightly job folds notes into `memory.md`. A weekly deep consolidation compresses *Recent* into *Patterns*, updates the longer arc, and — rarely — evolves `self.md`.

See [docs/memory-design.md](docs/memory-design.md) for the full design rationale.

## Installation

**Portainer (intended for production)**

The primary deployment path. Add the repo in Portainer under *Stacks → Repository*, point it at `docker-compose.prod.yml`, and supply env vars via the Portainer UI. Portainer builds and runs the container directly from source — no registry needed. Assumes an external PostgreSQL database and a host directory at `/opt/aug/data` owned by UID 1000.

**Local / Docker**

Includes a Postgres container, good for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aug.git
cd aug
cp .env.example .env  # fill in API_KEY, LLM_*, DATABASE_URL
docker compose up --build
```

## API

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness check |
| `POST` | `/chat/invoke` | Single-turn, full JSON response |
| `POST` | `/chat/stream` | SSE streaming response |
| `POST` | `/threads` | Create thread |
| `GET` | `/threads/{id}` | Thread metadata + history |
| `DELETE` | `/threads/{id}` | Delete thread |
| `POST` | `/files/upload` | Upload file |
| `GET` | `/files/{id}` | File metadata |

## Extending

**New agent** — subclass `BaseAgent` or `ChatAgent`, register in `aug/core/registry.py`:

```python
_REGISTRY["my_agent"] = ChatAgent(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    system_prompt="...",
    tools=[brave_search],
)
```

**New tool** — `@tool`-decorated function in `aug/core/tools/`, add to your agent in the registry.

Override hooks in your subclass: `preprocess`, `respond`, `postprocess` — each returns `AgentStateUpdate`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `API_KEY` | Yes | Shared secret for `X-API-Key` auth |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Yes | API key for your LLM provider |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | Yes | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | `postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:5432/dbname` |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | No | Telegram bot; disabled if absent |
| `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` | No | Comma-separated allowed chat IDs. Unset = all chats allowed. Get yours from `@userinfobot`. |
| `BRAVE_API_KEY` | No | Enables web search |
| `DEBUG` | No | `true` → human-readable logs; `false` (default) → JSON |
